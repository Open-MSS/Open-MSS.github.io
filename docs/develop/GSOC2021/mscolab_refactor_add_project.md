## mscolab refactor add project
-   **Project description**:
    Currently we have per flightpath a project. We want to have the ability to have many flightpathes below a project.
    In short words: 
    - add project will become the master key (namespace, with a prefix) and could have several flight pathes. This enables to have a seperation of project users on the server site. So we have only projects in a list and belonging flightpathes in an other list. Each flightpath can have something like labels or tags and can be sorted in the UI.
    - we will need a project description, project delete, project rename, project export, project import
        - project (export/import) will need filters, e.g. with users, with flightpath 
        - on flight path creation we need to destinguis to use for the chat the project namespace or a new flightpath related namespace
