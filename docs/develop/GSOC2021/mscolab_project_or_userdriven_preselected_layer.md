## mscolab Project or Userdriven Preselected Layer

- **Project description**

    Due to the increasing number of variables to be displayed (“layers”), it becomes more and more difficult to find the desired variable in the list.

    Typically people want to look always at the same set of variables. Therefore, it would be nice to have the opportunity to restrict the variable list to only those that one would like to see. 

    This should be done by a new widget plugged into the navigation of mscolab. 
   We want to have project related and user related layer configs. It could be more than one layer config. 
    If it is project related all members can see it and we should have same access rules. If it is in the user scope we may want to have a copy or move to the project scope. It should always be possible to select all layers too.
