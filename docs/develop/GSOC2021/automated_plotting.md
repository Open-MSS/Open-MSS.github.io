## Automated Plotting

-   **Project description**:
    The MSS tool is currently designed for interactive use and showing of layers in a UI. For post-campaign analysis, retrieving a standardized set of layers for hundreds of time-steps is desired, which cannot be accomplished in an efficient manner using the current UI.
    
    In this project, a prototype CLI tool for downloading images in an automated fashion shall be extended, tested and documented and enhanced by a GUI to configure the set of layers and time-steps to be downloaded. If feasible, the tool shall be integrated into the standard MSS UI.
