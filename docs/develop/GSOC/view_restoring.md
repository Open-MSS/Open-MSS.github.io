## mscolab: View Restoring 

- **Project description**:

    The PyQT Gui of the MSS client can currently handle different views by one flight path. This means once a new flight path is loaded and activated all views change to this flight path. 

    The mscolab UI should allow for storing and restoring the view configuration of multiple windows for the user for an operation. 
A configuration should been selectable for another flightpath and operation.
    There should also be a layout option given to any participant of the same flightpath. e.g. two topview connected to different servers
