## mswms: Plot Gallery integrated into server process

* **Project description**:

  MSS has a gallery feature which currently is a separate process. 
  It currently is called by the standalone server as additional command. 
  We want this to become additional builtin to the server process. 
  Configured by a yaml file and automated update after new datafiles are added. 
  Besides existing parameters new have to become enabled, e.g. mapsection, projection. 
  An extension to a larger project is to add an interactive user interface.
