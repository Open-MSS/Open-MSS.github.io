## Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW)

-   **Project description**:

    CSW is one element of the OGC Catalogue Service.
    We want our ogc wms server to expose a catalogue of geospatial records in XML on the Internet (over HTTP).
    The catalogue has records that describe geospatial data (e.g. KML), geospatial services (e.g. WMS), and related resources.
    The records are in XML according to the standard. 
    Our Server data should be useable by the MetaSearch of QGIS.
