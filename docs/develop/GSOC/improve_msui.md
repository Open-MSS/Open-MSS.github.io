# Improve MSUI

-   **Project description**:
-   We need some additions in the UI for users.
    - Leave all operations (independent of archived)
    - Upload to the mscolab db a small image to replace the initials on login and chat
    - Visualize how many users are working on an operation same time
    - Improve the chat, e.g. a channel for messages from the server
    - indicate new messages
    - Archive, unarchive based on a filter e.g. category
    - Version History should show any change, refresh button removed
