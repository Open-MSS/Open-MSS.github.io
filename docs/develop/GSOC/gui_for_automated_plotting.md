# GUI for Automated Plotting

-   **Project description**:
    The MSS tool is currently designed for interactive use and showing of layers in a UI. 
    For post-campaign analysis, retrieving a standardized set of layers for hundreds of time-steps 
    an automated plotting feature was developed.

    The automated plotting should be enhanced by a GUI to configure parameters such as set of layers,
    resolution and time-steps to be downloaded. If feasible, the tool shall be integrated into 
    the standard MSS UI.
